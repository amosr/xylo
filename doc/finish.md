# Finishing xylophone bars

Bucur's *Handbook of Materials for Percussion Instruments* suggests finishing tone bars with oil or varnish, but isn't very specific on the actual finishing. It's a very detailed book otherwise, so I gather from this that the actual oil used isn't too important.
Bucur's *Acoustics of Wood* describes the effect of varnish on small strips and shows that it can even effect the resonant frequency significantly --- both increasing and decreasing --- but it's not clear if this applies to tone bars.

There's a heap of prior work on computational geometry for tuning tone bars, but I didn't find any of it that mentioned finishing or varnishing the bars.

Most studies on the effect of finishing on wood acoustics seem to focus on stringed instruments. Br√©maud et al. (2016) notes that the acoustic changes are time-delayed, after applying a mixture of linseed oil and sandarac resin varnish. The finish is initially liquid and does not significantly affect the acoustics, but with time or curing with UV light, the acoustics are dampened.

Options:
* Kunos natural oil sealer
* Old English Scratch Cover for Light Wood, suggested by [Orff](https://teachingwithorff.com/scariest-instrument-restoration/)
* Tung oil, also suggested by [Orff](https://teachingwithorff.com/scariest-instrument-restoration/)

* Scott's Liquid Gold? Maybe for guitars: https://www.scottsliquidgold.com/
* Linseed oil?
