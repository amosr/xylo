# Tasks

## Cut bar stock
[tonebars.html]


## Measure bar stock spectrum
* measure at centre and corner, record both

> When such a beam is struck at its centre, the natural bending frequencies could be observed, whereas when the beam is struck at the corner, the bending and torsional frequencies could be observed.
(Zhao 2011)

## Compute bar geometries
See evosax.ipynb

## Perform pre-cuts
* Measure spectrum for each bar and cut

## Adjust final cuts
See bars.ipynb

## Perform final cuts

## Finish bars
Tung oil?

## Construct frame
